When we ended things, I never confessed how I really felt about you. For a long time, I never admitted it to anyone, not even to myself. It was easier to lie than to confront my true feelings and have to contemplate whether they mirrored your own. It sounds cliché, but for a while, you were everything to me. Even though to you, I was probably nothing. I didn't just know that I wanted to be with you. I needed to be with you. I think I maybe even saw a future. I envisioned your face at the end of the aisle once, smirking at me as I paraded through all the pomp and circumstance. It would be over-the-top and ridiculous and ceremonial, but it wouldn't matter because we'd smile at each other and you'd just know what I was thinking. It would be obvious because you'd be thinking it too. I always sort of wondered if you felt the same unspoken bond between us - the way we could just look at each other and communicate without saying a word. But it was easier to wonder than to know, because knowing would destroy the illusion I had created for myself that one day we would end up together. You were upfront from the beginning about not wanting anything serious, but that didn't change the way your eyes would light up when I smiled at you. It didn't detract from all the the times you would appease me and hold me for just a little bit longer, because I loved to be cuddled and you loved that I loved to be cuddled, because maybe, just maybe, you loved me too.You didn't want anything serious, but you also didn't want to just sleep with me. You wanted to stay up and talk into the late hours of the night. You wanted to smoke and giggle and share inside jokes. You wanted to learn about my job and my family and my friends. You wanted to cook me breakfast and let me linger long after it was time for me to go home. You wanted to be there to celebrate my twenty-sixth. You wanted to buy me a birthday present. You didn't need to do any of those things, but you wanted to do them. So, I wanted to believe you when you said you didn't want anything serious, but I never did and a part of me still doesn't. Your actions were inconsistent with your words, so over time, your words lost their potency. Months went by of us going back and forth, but I never lost hope that this would all work out in the end. It was impossible for two people to have such a strong connection and not develop into something more serious.Except when we did eventually talk about where this was going, I was hit with the thing that I was most afraid of, the truth. My worst fears had been confirmed: you didn't see yourself with me in the long-term. It was over. Almost a full year of optimism had been crushed in a mere thirty-minute conversation. I had my answers, but they weren't the ones I wanted to hear. I had been through this all before and back, but this time was different somehow. More serious, more permanent, and much, much more devastating. But of course, I never let it show.The pressure to remain casual didn't end with our casual relationship. I still had to play the part of the cool girl, even after we were done. Just like that, I had gone from opening up about my feelings to repressing them all over again. I was hysterical and dejected on the inside, but you would never see my cheeks painted with the tears you had triggered. You would never hear me raise my voice. You would never taste the sadness on my lips. You would never sense the pain you had caused me - because that would also imply you had once brought me pleasure.I resigned myself to this line of thinking instead of working through my anger. I never signed up for that kickboxing class like I said I would. I never went back to that therapist an old friend had recommended to me. I never allowed myself to go crazy and hurl dishes in a blind rage, watching them shatter into pieces like my heart when I realized this was never going to be anything more than a convenient hook up. Still, I was desperate to do anything I could to get over you. Anything other than facing the reality that maybe this just hurt more because some part of me was hopelessly in love with you. Various friends had pointed it out to me before, but I was even playing it cool with them. I was so embarrassed by my feelings for you because I think some part of me always recognized I was just in love with the idea of something that was never going to happen. You and I dating was just a pipe dream, a fantasy. I could keep pretending it was real, but at the end of the day, it was time for me to wake up.It's been several months, but I'm afraid if I keep this darkness inside any longer, then I'm going to start to lose myself completely. My broken heart has started to have something of a ripple effect on my consciousness and I feel myself slowly spiraling out of control, all the while you go on living and breathing and never even knowing the way you made my insides curl by just looking at me or sending me a trivial, pointless snapchat. It was all so immature and lighthearted, but then again, so is love.I never told you all of this because I'm not as brave as I pretend to be sometimes. I was terrified of the truth. Terrified of my intensely crippling feelings for you. Maybe I'll never know what I really was to you. I'm not sure I want to know, after everything, after all. All I know is that I loved you. *** 041bbadc738eaadf024ab8cb5c041778*** Location: raleigh *** Time: 2017-10-12", "CUTE BLONDE ON 'A TRAIN' - m4w - missed connections *** CUTE BLONDE ON 'A TRAIN' - OCTOBER 11 - 6:20PMYou got on at 34 Street and caught my attention --- you have a AWESOME slim bodyand were wearing a light green rain jacket.You got off at either High Street or Jay Street --- I lost sight of you...If you see this, reach out and say 'Hi!!!'Keep Smiling!!! *** 6638cd6d8fc4289cc88e0e4b460bb3e3*** Location: newyork *** Time: 2017-10-12", "Cary Vision Care - m4w - missed connections *** You came into Cary Vision Care with your daughter to pick up her glasses this afternoon.

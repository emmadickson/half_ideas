When we ended things, I never confessed how I really felt about you. For a long time, I never admitted it to anyone, not even to myself. It was easier to lie than to confront my true feelings and have to contemplate whether they mirrored your own. It sounds cliché, but for a while, you were everything to me. Even though to you, I was probably nothing. I didn't just know that I wanted to be with you. I needed to be with you. I think I maybe even saw a future. I envisioned your face at the end of the aisle once, smirking at me as I paraded through all the pomp and circumstance. It would be over-the-top and ridiculous and ceremonial, but it wouldn't matter because we'd smile at each other and you'd just know what I was thinking. It would be obvious because you'd be thinking it too. I always sort of wondered if you felt the same unspoken bond between us - the way we could just look at each other and communicate without saying a word. But it was easier to wonder than to know, because knowing would destroy the illusion I had created for myself that one day we would end up together. You were upfront from the beginning about not wanting anything serious, but that didn't change the way your eyes would light up when I smiled at you. It didn't detract from all the the times you would appease me and hold me for just a little bit longer, because I loved to be cuddled and you loved that I loved to be cuddled, because maybe, just maybe, you loved me too.You didn't want anything serious, but you also didn't want to just sleep with me. You wanted to stay up and talk into the late hours of the night. You wanted to smoke and giggle and share inside jokes. You wanted to learn about my job and my family and my friends. You wanted to cook me breakfast and let me linger long after it was time for me to go home. You wanted to be there to celebrate my twenty-sixth. You wanted to buy me a birthday present. You didn't need to do any of those things, but you wanted to do them. So, I wanted to believe you when you said you didn't want anything serious, but I never did and a part of me still doesn't. Your actions were inconsistent with your words, so over time, your words lost their potency. Months went by of us going back and forth, but I never lost hope that this would all work out in the end. It was impossible for two people to have such a strong connection and not develop into something more serious.Except when we did eventually talk about where this was going, I was hit with the thing that I was most afraid of, the truth. My worst fears had been confirmed: you didn't see yourself with me in the long-term. It was over. Almost a full year of optimism had been crushed in a mere thirty-minute conversation. I had my answers, but they weren't the ones I wanted to hear. I had been through this all before and back, but this time was different somehow. More serious, more permanent, and much, much more devastating. But of course, I never let it show.The pressure to remain casual didn't end with our casual relationship. I still had to play the part of the cool girl, even after we were done. Just like that, I had gone from opening up about my feelings to repressing them all over again. I was hysterical and dejected on the inside, but you would never see my cheeks painted with the tears you had triggered. You would never hear me raise my voice. You would never taste the sadness on my lips. You would never sense the pain you had caused me - because that would also imply you had once brought me pleasure.I resigned myself to this line of thinking instead of working through my anger. I never signed up for that kickboxing class like I said I would. I never went back to that therapist an old friend had recommended to me. I never allowed myself to go crazy and hurl dishes in a blind rage, watching them shatter into pieces like my heart when I realized this was never going to be anything more than a convenient hook up. Still, I was desperate to do anything I could to get over you. Anything other than facing the reality that maybe this just hurt more because some part of me was hopelessly in love with you. Various friends had pointed it out to me before, but I was even playing it cool with them. I was so embarrassed by my feelings for you because I think some part of me always recognized I was just in love with the idea of something that was never going to happen. You and I dating was just a pipe dream, a fantasy. I could keep pretending it was real, but at the end of the day, it was time for me to wake up.It's been several months, but I'm afraid if I keep this darkness inside any longer, then I'm going to start to lose myself completely. My broken heart has started to have something of a ripple effect on my consciousness and I feel myself slowly spiraling out of control, all the while you go on living and breathing and never even knowing the way you made my insides curl by just looking at me or sending me a trivial, pointless snapchat. It was all so immature and lighthearted, but then again, so is love.I never told you all of this because I'm not as brave as I pretend to be sometimes. I was terrified of the truth. Terrified of my intensely crippling feelings for you. Maybe I'll never know what I really was to you. I'm not sure I want to know, after everything, after all. All I know is that I loved you. *** 041bbadc738eaadf024ab8cb5c041778*** Location: raleigh *** Time: 2017-10-12", "CUTE BLONDE ON 'A TRAIN' - m4w - missed connections *** CUTE BLONDE ON 'A TRAIN' - OCTOBER 11 - 6:20PMYou got on at 34 Street and caught my attention --- you have a AWESOME slim bodyand were wearing a light green rain jacket.You got off at either High Street or Jay Street --- I lost sight of you...If you see this, reach out and say 'Hi!!!'Keep Smiling!!! *** 6638cd6d8fc4289cc88e0e4b460bb3e3*** Location: newyork *** Time: 2017-10-12", "Cary Vision Care - m4w - missed connections *** You came into Cary Vision Care with your daughter to pick up her glasses this afternoon.

Yet all willmake progress in healing and rowing toward wholeness again... often with newhard‐won wisdom, and with scar tissue yes, and also often with a heart brokenopen... a focused desire to help the needful world in ongoing or in new ways.Thus, over a period of time, if you of 'the inner circle,' that is, if you are an eye‐witness, a helper, a first responder, a victim, a survivor, a person who lost a lovedone, or lost cherished creatures, or had a loved one in the path of danger, orseriously injured ...if you have been suddenly hit hard by tragedy or by fear and shock and heartachefor the world as you once knew it... if you are a soul in the midst of the disaster, abrother, sister, mother, father, child, elder... if you are military, fire fighter, healthworker, helping‐professional, law enforcement, government helper, rescue worker,citizen rescuer, news gatherer, photographer‐‐‐if you have heart, spirit and soulconnection to the tragedy‐‐ if you are in other close‐in relationships such as helpingin distributions of essentials, supplier, friend‐to‐friend, neighbor to neighbor,pastor, spiritual advisor... you may find yourself having one or more of the followingreactions.(These are normal reactions to sudden shock relating to life and death events, tosudden twists of fate. When one has been involved in a critical incident, one's body,one's consciousness and heart (and many believe, too, the spirit and the soul) areshocked as well.This is because it is shocking to see in full consciousness, in a split second, how closedeath always is to us, and how suddenly it erupted into our world visibly, palpably,and how fast, how loudly, but sometimes so quietly... This witness to the nearness ofdeath and destruction and the terrible losses of life, are arresting to any humanbeing with a heart and spirit, a mind and body, and a soul.)NORMAL AND COMMON REACTIONSPHYSICAL REACTIONS:● Sleep disturbances including inability to sleep● Lethargy may come from sleeping too much, eating allergenic or spoiledsubstances.● Exhaustion, fatigue, nagging sense of dread once the crises are far past● Changes in appetite, digestive disturbances● Feeling numb● Crying, sometimes without necessarily knowing why● Desire to comfort and be comforted physically● Nightmares, night terrors● Loss of memory● Trembling, inner and/or outer● Nausea● Heart arrhythmia● Pain in heart, not an organic disorder, but caused bysorrow● Aching bones, not an organic disorder but rather,caused by sorrow● Headache, pre‐migraine syndrome; migraine● Possible augmenting of symptoms of diabetes, prior stress conditions, sciatica,asthma●Regression in children to a previously mastered stage of developmentBEHAVIORAL REACTIONS:● Hyperactivity● Poor concentration● Refusing to talk● Wanting to go away, or hide● Talking 'out of one's mind'● Startle reactions while awake or asleep● Isolating, wanting to be alone.● Wanting to just sit, or just stare● Trying to help in any way one can, to the point ofexhaustion;● Not wanting to leave the scene for aid or safety● Weeping oneself to sleep● Hyper‐vigilance, watching, listening, being unable tobe at restPSYCHOLOGICAL REACTIONS:● Loss of sense of time● Feeling distraught and helpless and alone● Feeling that things are not real, as though in a dream● Inability to recall sequences or retrace all of one's steps precisely● Feeling the future has been lost forever● Desire to comfort and be comforted psychologically● Feeling one should not cry● Wanting to scream, or screaming‐weeping● Inability to attach importance to anything but this event● Flashbacks● Nightmares● Sorrowing in actual and symbolic ways● Intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety● Over‐reactions to mild to moderate irritations● Recurrent dreams● Horrified Anger● Broken Heart● Insecurity about the future● Feelings of fear, warranted and unwarranted● Feelings of guilt● Feeling one cannot stop crying● Unusual reserve, acting as though nothing much really occurred● Blaming others, individuals, groups: there may be passionate outbursts● Marked frustration with how long everything takes● Marked frustration with rescue workers, the bureaucracy, anyone who is tryingto help● Marked frustration [based on reality] with any who break promises to help, orwho are perceived to not be telling all the truth, or who are perceived to bewithholding critical information, or giving misinformation or not telling all theyknow, or who are giving out platitudes or being condescending● Ongoing violent fantasies● Rolling episodes of anxiety● Mild to profound depression● Amnesia● Thinking no one can ever understand, no one can ever help.● Valid fear for one's safety● Replaying over and over the pain of what one has seen and heard● Keeping secrets about what one might have known beforehand, during or after● Blaming oneself● Deep dread about hearing any more terrible news● Aversion to films, movies, radio, television, anything that depicts catastrophe● Irritability that others go on with life while one is still suffering● Negative judgments about others' activities or interests that seem disrespectfulto oneself and what one is going throughSPIRITUAL REACTIONS:● Desire to comfort and be comforted spiritually● Questioning one's beliefs● Not wanting to hear any spiritual counsel● Wanting very much to hear spiritual counsel● Feeling the celestial beings/ greater Power/Creator/God, the true self haveabandoned everyone● Feeling the celestial beings/ greater Power/Creator/God, the true self are evernear● Desire to create meaningful ceremony● Praying non‐stop, for self, for others, for everyoneFOR THE SURVIVORS:THE DESCENT INTO, AND THE PATHWAYS OUT OF TRAUMAThese are normal reactions, though many are painful. Thankfully, no one has allof them, and some, such as 'more prayer than usual' can be helpful to many. It isimportant to remember that all souls have their own ways of remaining strong.Some have a lifetime of 'not talking.' This is their way of preserving their own paceand peace.Some make jokes as their way of remaining strong. Some weep, and in this they arecleansed and strengthened. Some work themselves to exhaustion, for this is theirway of staying strong. Some want to hear every update so they can prepare; that istheir strength. Some want to hear nothing more, not ever, unless solutions are alsooffered‐‐ and that is the person bulwarking themselves in order to strive to staystrong in the midst of all else.The many different ways people 'stay strong' in their own ways ought be respectedas much as possible, with invitations to join in if there is a better way to proceed inthe present. Only if 'staying strong' is bringing real harms to the person or to otherpersons, should the eccentricities of 'staying strong' be mediated by offering otherways to move, think, see, hear, feel in attitude and action.Going through the pattern of shock symptoms [above], trying to pinpoint each orsome, and finding one's own ways of easing these, putting first things first - health,safety, attitude - these are all part of the direct healing process.No one can instantly cleanse these thoughts and feelings away, though I wish wecould, for we know they can tear at heart, consciousness, and spirit and can makepeople feel half‐dead or in continual dread.But as time passes, many of these will lift more and more, and many will pass too.Especially if we hold to right understanding, right action, right thought. The mostimportant is to know what to do for oneself to help the natural process of mendingup after twists of fate that affect us so deeply.Many years ago our beloved first‐born grandson died suddenly. We made the slowpainful walk back from the land of the dead. It took much time. We felt deadourselves. A succinct truth about coming back after such trauma, eventually camethrough my dear daughter whose child had been lost. She said. 'We never overcomeprofound loss: We learn to live with it.'And this will assuredly be so for you also. You will find your way to live fully againwith this time in background, not foreground.The day will come. And you will see, month by month forward, this will occur moreand more.For some persons, after tragedy, they know immediately what they think and feel.For others who are be‐numbed, they may not know where and how they stand withthe events and with themselves and with others for quite some time afterward. Thisis alright. New life will come. Being thoughtful and watchful of one's own processesdaily is a good endeavor.If you can't recall the qualities, paths and sanctities most useful, ask trusted othersto help you take daily steps to help yourself as needed. Just like a new garden, takeone thoughtful step after the other. Assess, spade, seed, water, light, weed, tenderly,thoughtfully tend to... then one day comes the flowering and then after that, thefruits.For those close in to the disaster, the tragedy, the numbness you feel comes fromparts of your self protecting you, softening for a time, the profound overwhelm of allthat has occurred, allowing you to at least go through many of the mundane motionsof day to day life. For the first days after such enormous shocks, it may almost feel asthough time has stopped. That all is surreal. The efforts to comb hair, shave,organize may be dulled.You may feel as though you are no longer here. As though maybe you are dead ordeadened. Even as you go about lifting, hauling, helping. This is because abject fear,horror, and/or tragedy throw us into a process and lock us in for a time - yet, ourbalancing pathways through difficulties did not die. We can find them and followthem again.For most who have been suddenly beset by deep fear, and/or suddenly lost belovedpersons, an animal companion, or a home place, or all these... 'descent' is not toostrong a word for the process afterward. To many, it feels like a big iron gate hasclosed behind them and that life will never be the same again.And yet, please also be assured there is an indirect healing process taking placeinside you at the same time... time passing is one indirect but strong healing partner.As time goes on, there is also blessing news... and that is, that fear and horror andgrief are wheels that turn. Grief has a beginning, a middle and not exactly an end, buta release from that trapped place behind 'the iron gate' where you may have feltburdened off and on, or relentlessly.Eventually the sense of helplessness, fatigue, guardedness, hyper‐vigilance, sorrow,blaming oneself or others, and/or 'not knowing' dwindles and eases. You will dailylive and laugh and love life again, more and more ... it will happen. Not right thismoment. But it will come.• As time goes on, less and less will you be dragged backward in time to verybriefly, but deeply, feel fearful or grieve anew. Those times will occur with longerand longer spans of time in between. Each episode of 'sudden remembering' will beintense, but last for shorter and shorter periods of time. Again, for most of us, we donot 'get over' life and death heart‐wrenching events. *** e7fc30e8497ba8f15cfca919e1590726*** Location: newyork *** Time: 2017-10-20", "Lacking Commitment - Seeking to Make Babies with You!!! - m4w - m4w - missed connections *** Hey I'm looking for a Spanish guy wearing a red jacket, grey pants,grey shoes and you were on the 1 train and got off at Columbus circle.

Accordingly, I never asked for your phone number, which means I have no way to get in touch with you. Yeah, I feel stupid now that I didn't ask for your phone number, but Carrboro is a small place and I thought there would be a good chance of running into you again. So far that has not been the casethough, so I am posting this in the hope that you might see it.I asked you about the insulin pump you were wearing. We also discussed the tattoo you had, which had to do with a beloved pet you had in the past.We exchanged a hug at the end of the night, you walked home with your girl friend, and I rode home on my motorcycle which you had urged me not to ride. I made it home safe, as I said I would, but your concern for my safety was very sweet.I'd really like to see you again.Please contact me. *** 110f0930165e367a35356a705bbda872*** Location: raleigh *** Time: 2017-10-20", "Family Fare BP, Guess Rd., Across from Popeye's - w4m - missed connections *** Yesterday afternoon at Homedepot.....You are a tall beautiful woman that was with an older man.  we both looked at each other and smiled.
